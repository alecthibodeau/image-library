### Image Library

#### Overview

I'm a software developer and a visual artist. This repository serves as an image library for various purposes. To see a collection of my software development projects visit my code portfolio site: [alect.me](https://alect.me).

#### Moon Space

[Moon Space](https://huetown.com/moon-space) is a lunar calendar interface at Huetown, a web shop I built with React and TypeScript. Moon Space is a digital interpretation of the lunar calendar prints on paper that are available at the site. When a user lands at Moon Space they see the current date for the Eastern Time Zone, the name of this date's moon phase and a visualization of the phase: a bright moon against a dark sky. Learn more at [Huetown's README](https://github.com/alecthibodeau/huetown/blob/main/README.md).

I recorded the following video in December 2024, ahead of a live presentation at a local coding group. Updates to certain features have occurred in the intervening time.
